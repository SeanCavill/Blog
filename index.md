## RES701 first blog post

### - What do you think 'research' is?

Research is the intentional study and gathering of information in order to find out more about a particular subject area. This can be done in many ways, from reading material, to finding answers to questions, to testing ideas. 

### - Do you think you will ever need research skills?

Research is important in order to discover and come to new understandings on topics. I think I need research skills in order
to expand my understanding and come to informed conclusions on things I am interested in or need to know about.

### - What do you think a research journal is and who is it written for?

A research journal is created in order to keep a record of important discoveries relevant to the topic of research. It can be used to keep track of different studies and present new ideas to the reader. It is written for people who are studying or interested in a particular topic, and can be used by that person for expanding their knowledge and reviewing certain methods and ideas.

### - What is plagarism?

Plagarism involves taking someone else's work and presenting it as your own. This can either be done intentionally or un-intentionally. An example of plagarism would be copying someone's paper and claiming ownnership.

### - Why is it important to avoid it?

Plagarism can be harmful to the original author(s), who have put in their own time, effort, and sometimes even money in order to create something. Without proper acknowledgment or permission it is equivalent stealing. The plagiriser is taking credit for the author(s) work without any form of compensation which can cause harm by taking away recognition which could lead to harm both monetary and career wise.

## Blog 2 ontology and epistemology

### What is ontology? How is it relevant to research?

Ontology is the study of existence, being, and what is. It deals with the nature of reality and what is possible for us to know about the world. Ontology is relevant to research as it allows the researcher to realize the nature and existence of what they are researching, what they can claim as truth or real, and how they can reconcile differences between other researchers conflicting views of reality.

###What is epistemology? How is it relevant to research?

Epistemology is the study of knowledge. It deals with questions such as: What can we know about reality? And how do we gather knowledge? What is knowledge and what can we know about the world fall under epistemology. Epistemology is important to research because it helps the researcher understand how to acquire and justify their knowledge on a topic.

### What is the connection between ontology and epistemology in a research context?

Ontology and Epistemology help create a framework in which researchers can interpret and discuss each other’s ideas. Ontology helps a researcher decide what it is they’re going to be researching, and epistemology aids them in the method of deciding how they’re going to gain information and knowledge about that reality.

## Blog post 3 research paradigms

In class we discussed research paradigms. A research paradigm is a world view held by a researcher in which they use this paradigm to construct their research.  A research paradigm consists of ontology, epistemology, methodology and methods. Ontology is the question of what is, epistemology is what we know and can know about what is, methodologies are how we go about getting that knowledge, and methods are what we use to acquire that knowledge.

### Below are the three paradigms we discussed

- Classic Scientific Paradigm.

The classical scientific paradigm believes that only things that can be scientifically verifiable or proven through maths and logic are valid.

- Social Science paradigm

The social science paradigm believes truth is socially constructed and is constantly changing with society. All our social interactions are what frames our reality.

- Post Modernist paradigm

Post modernists reject the previous paradigms, instead choosing to believe everything is subjective or relative and that there is nothing that is objective.

### What paradigm do I fall under?

My work at NMIT has involved scientific paradigms. If I have to design a nice looking interface that is use friendly for say a website I need to be able to understand how people are going to interact with my website and what effects their way of thinking. I may also use the classical scientific approach to find out the most efficient way of implementing some code, or what component for a PC is best using facts and statistics.

I would say in general that I fall under the scientific paradigm, though. I believe most of the world we interact with can be explained logically through verifiable research. And that things that aren’t explained now are likely to be explained in the future as our methods become more advanced. I believe humans for the most part have a shared experience of the world and we sense and perceive the same things which we can then measure.

Overall I think all of the paradigms have their own validity and that there is no way of actually knowing what the correct answer is. I choose to go with the scientific approach as I believe it is most effective to advancing humanity and creating a world I want to live in.

# Blog post 5

In this blog post I am going to discuss different sources for finding information, and the credibility of those sources. The two topics I am going to look into are Computational thinking and virtualistation technology. For both of these topics I will find 3 different sources for each and comment on how I found the article, who it was created by and how credible I think the source is.

## Computational Thinking

### First Source: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2008.0118

For my first source I went on to google scholar which I believe to be a good place to find academic articles. I googled the direct topic "Computational Thinking" and found the first source which wasn't behind a paywall. It was created by Jeanette M Wing and published on the 31/07/2008. It is as article discussing different topics surrounding computational thinking.

Because of the methods I used to find the source I am already on the side of the article being credible. It contains an abstract, is well written and structured, and is hosted on a website called The Royal Society Publishing, which makes me believe it is a credible source for information.

### Second Source: https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zp92mp3/revision/1

For my second source I did a basic google search of computational thinking and looked through the top results that came up and chose an article by the BBC. There is no Author or date listed on the page. It is a revision guide.

The page comes is more of a study guide rather than an article or a discussion on the topic. The use of different colors on the page, words being put in bold, and adverts makes me slightly question the credibility of the content. The way it is presented with images and headings makes me feel like the page is a little "dumbed down" and that it wouldn't have many high level ideas about the topics. The page also lists no author or reference which brings into doubt the methods used by them to gather information. However, because it is published by the BBC and I believe them to be a credible source(at least for educational content) I think the page has a moderite level of credibility.

### Third Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbnTZCj0ugI

For my second source I decided to go to youtube and searched the question: "What is computational thinking?" And used the first result returned by the youtube algorithm. The video is created by a channel named Paxton/Patterson, and was published 9/5/2018. It is a video discussing what computational thinking and how it is used.

The video is top of the search results  and has thosuands of views which would initially lead me to believe that it was popular and peer reviewed by other people. When I started the video, however, it had quite obnoxious music, sound effects, and editing style. The Likes and comments had also been disabled by the owners of the channel. Coming from youtube I wouldn't usually trust the validity of the information without looking through what other users had thought of it, so the fact that other user's ability to publically review and discuss the content was disabled I think the information could be poor.

## Virtualisation Technology

### First Source: https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/ebook/gated-vmw-ebook-virtualization-essentials.pdf

When I used google to reserach virtulization technology, the first result was from VMware and their information page had further reading which led me to this PDF. The PDF itself has no listed author or date on it. The PDF introduces virtualisation and implementation of it.

The PDF is layed out like a business document with a cover page, Table of contents, and page numbers which makes me believe it is credible as if they're willing to put work into the presentation they have likely put work into the research behind the content. It also containes references for where they have sourced information which in my opinion if you increase the amount of independent sources the information becomes more credible. A downside to the PDF is that it is created by a company who are interested in gaining clients to use their software, so any information they would try to portray is going to push their solutions.

### Second Source: https://go-gale-com.nmit.idm.oclc.org/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T002&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&hitCount=880&searchType=BasicSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CA232178970&docType=Report&sort=Relevance&contentSegment=ZONE-MOD1&prodId=AONE&pageNum=1&contentSet=GALE%7CA232178970&searchId=R1&userGroupName=per_nmit&inPS=true

For my second source I went through NMITs library services to find information on virtualisation technology. I ended up on Gale Academic OneFile and used the term "virtualization technology" to find the article.  The Author of the article is Dale L. Lunsford and the Date of publication is Fall 2009. The academic paper discusses virtualisation technologies in information systems education.

Because I used a learning institutions resources I am more likely to believe the article is credible. It ticks off all the main components of an academic paper which makes me trust the source. 

### Third Source: https://vietstack.wordpress.com/2014/10/03/introduction-of-virtualization/

For the third source I decided to use google and search wordpress blogs for virtualization technology. The Author is "ViteStack" and the publication date is 3/10/2014. It is a blog post on virtualisation.

I was first sceptical because it was a private word press blog which lowered the credibility I had for the source. The Author isn't listed as someone's name, but the name of the blog which makes it seem less professional. There is not a list of references on the page, and for some of the images it simple states Source:Google which shows a lack of credit to the original source. The presentation of the site does add some credibility as it is layed out nicely and uses nice font and headers.

##Summary

Throughout doing this blog I have recognized different sources and what makes a source seem credible to me. I am more likely to trust sources that are academic papers, and that I have found through a site or method that I trust. I have found that I don't have faith when it comes to sourcing my information from blogs and videos posted on youtube.
