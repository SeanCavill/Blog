### - What do you think 'research' is?

Research is the intentional study and gathering of information in order to find out more about a particular subject area. This can be done in many ways, from reading material, to finding answers to questions, to testing ideas. 

### - Do you think you will ever need research skills?

Research is important in order to discover and come to new understandings on topics. I think I need research skills in order
to expand my understanding and come to informed conclusions on things I am interested in or need to know about.

### - What do you think a research journal is and who is it written for?

A research journal is created in order to keep a record of important discoveries relevant to the topic of research. It can be used to keep track of different studies and present new ideas to the reader. It is written for people who are studying or interested in a particular topic, and can be used by that person for expanding their knowledge and reviewing certain methods and ideas.

### - What is plagarism?

Plagarism involves taking someone else's work and presenting it as your own. This can either be done intentionally or un-intentionally. An example of plagarism would be copying someone's paper and claiming ownnership.

### - Why is it important to avoid it?

Plagarism can be harmful to the original author(s), who have put in their own time, effort, and sometimes even money in order to create something. Without proper acknowledgment or permission it is equivalent stealing. The plagiriser is taking credit for the author(s) work without any form of compensation which can cause harm by taking away recognition which could lead to harm both monetary and career wise.

What is ontology? How is it relevant to research?

Ontology is the study of existence, being, and what is. It deals with the nature of reality and what is possible for us to know about the world. Ontology is relevant to research as it allows the researcher to realize the nature and existence of what they are researching, what they can claim as truth or real, and how they can reconcile differences between other researchers conflicting views of reality.

What is epistemology? How is it relevant to research?

Epistemology is the study of knowledge. It deals with questions such as: What can we know about reality? And how do we gather knowledge? What is knowledge and what can we know about the world fall under epistemology. Epistemology is important to research because it helps the researcher understand how to acquire and justify their knowledge on a topic.

What is the connection between ontology and epistemology in a research context?

Ontology and Epistemology help create a framework in which researchers can interpret and discuss each other’s ideas. Ontology helps a researcher decide what it is they’re going to be researching, and epistemology aids them in the method of deciding how they’re going to gain information and knowledge about that reality.

Blog post 3 research paradigms

In class we discussed research paradigms. A research paradigm is a world view held by a researcher in which they use this paradigm to construct their research.  A research paradigm consists of ontology, epistemology, methodology and methods. Ontology is the question of what is, epistemology is what we know and can know about what is, methodologies are how we go about getting that knowledge, and methods are what we use to acquire that knowledge.

Below are the three paradigms we discussed

Classic Scientific Paradigm.

The classical scientific paradigm believes that only things that can be scientifically verifiable or proven through maths and logic are valid.

Social Science paradigm

The social science paradigm believes truth is socially constructed and is constantly changing with society. All our social interactions are what frames our reality.

Post Modernist paradigm

Post modernists reject the previous paradigms, instead choosing to believe everything is subjective or relative and that there is nothing that is objective.

What paradigm do I fall under?

My work at NMIT has involved scientific paradigms. If I have to design a nice looking interface that is use friendly for say a website I need to be able to understand how people are going to interact with my website and what effects their way of thinking. I may also use the classical scientific approach to find out the most efficient way of implementing some code, or what component for a PC is best using facts and statistics.

I would say in general that I fall under the scientific paradigm, though. I believe most of the world we interact with can be explained logically through verifiable research. And that things that aren’t explained now are likely to be explained in the future as our methods become more advanced. I believe humans in general have a shared experience of the world and we sense and perceive the same things which we can then measure.

Overall I think all of the paradigms have their own validity and that there is no way of actually knowing what the correct answer is. I choose to go with the scientific approach as I believe it is most effective to advancing humanity and creating a world I want to live in.
