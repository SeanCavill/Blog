###- What do you think 'research' is?

Research is the intentional study and gathering of information in order to find out more about a particular subject area. This can be done in many ways, from reading material, to finding answers to questions, to testing ideas. 

###- Do you think you will ever need research skills?

Research is important in order to discover and come to new understandings on topics. I think I need research skills in order
to expand my understanding and come to informed conclusions on things I am interested in or need to know about.

###- What do you think a research journal is and who is it written for?

A research journal is created in order to keep a record of important discoveries relevant to the topic of research. It can be used to keep track of different studies and present new ideas to the reader. It is written for people who are studying or interested in a particular topic, and can be used by that person for expanding their knowledge and reviewing certain methods and ideas.

###- What is plagarism?

Plagarism involves taking someone else's work and presenting it as your own. This can either be done intentionally or un-intentionally. An example of plagarism would be copying someone's paper and claiming ownnership.

###- Why is it important to avoid it?

Plagarism can be harmful to the original author(s), who have put in their own time, effort, and sometimes even money in order to create something. Without proper acknowledgment or permission it is equivalent stealing. The plagiriser is taking credit for the author(s) work without any form of compensation which can cause harm by taking away recognition which could lead to harm both monetary and career wise.
